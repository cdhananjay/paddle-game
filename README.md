### Paddle Game
This coding exercise is part of my presentation on 2D collisions mechanics for my college course, Applied Phyiscs for Gaming. My goal with this exercise is to help students understand the importance of physics in gaming through an interactive learning experience.

## Objective
Complete the missing implementation (denoted with `????`) in **`starter-code.c`**, specifically **lines 50–64**.

## Files Included
- `starter-code.c` — Contains the incomplete implementation.
- `solution.c` — Provides the completed solution for reference.
